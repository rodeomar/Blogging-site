    <h3>03/14/2023</h3>
    <p>Today was a wild coffee trip. First thing when I woke up was to make a big pot bacause daylight savings timee really messed me up. I downed a cup before even leaving  my apartment and brought another couple cups with me to class. If I didn't have coffee I don't know how I would survive</p>

    <p>I didn't have any coffee today and I couldn't wake up. I forgot to  buy coffee when I went food shopping and had none at my house. I was even too tired to get outside and go to the shop to buy coffee. Coffee is life.</p>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I used to normally drink coffe a lot. Like 8 shots a day. Then I started having trouble going to bed so I lowered that amount to just 4 shots per day. And now I'm down to just 1 cup of black coffee a day.</p>
