  <h1>How coffee affects our lives</h1>
  <h2>Experiences</h2>
  <h3>03/14/2023</h3>
  <p>Today was a wild coffee trip. First thing when I woke up was to make a big pot bacause daylight savings timee really messed me up. I downed a cup before even leaving  my apartment and brought another couple cups with me to class. If I didn't have coffee I don't know how I would survive</p>
  <h3>3/2/2023</h3>
  <p>I didn't have any coffee today and I couldn't wake up. I forgot to  buy coffee when I went food shopping and had none at my house. I was even too tired to get outside and go to the shop to buy coffee. Coffee is life.</p>
